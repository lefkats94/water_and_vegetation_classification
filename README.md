# water_and_vegetation_classification
The water and vegetation classifier is a thresholding method that utilizes Sentinel-2 data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to classify areas into four distinct classes. These classes include land, representing areas without significant water or vegetation; open water, indicative of regions with visible water bodies; floating vegetation, identifying portions where vegetation appears to float on the water surface; and emergent vegetation, denoting areas where vegetation emerges above the water surface. This classifier proves effective in discerning various land cover types, offering valuable insights into landscape composition and facilitating applications such as environmental monitoring and ecosystem analysis.
